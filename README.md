📘 Student Management System (C Programming Project)

This is my mini-project for the Programming in C course (1st semester, B.Tech CSE).
I made this project to practice the concepts taught in class such as structures, functions, file handling, dynamic memory, pointers, arrays, and modular programming.

The program is a simple Student Management System where we can store, update, delete, search and sort student records.
All data is saved in a text file so that the records stay even after closing the program.

🎯 Features

1. Add new student records

2. Display all students

3. Search by student ID

4. Modify existing student details

5. Delete a student

6. Sort by ID or Name

7. Store marks dynamically for each student

8. Save and load data using file handling

9. Small demos using:

10. Recursion (factorial)

11. Pointers (swap demo)

12. 2D dynamic arrays (marks matrix)

🧠 Concepts Used

This project covers multiple topics from the syllabus:

1. Structures and unions

2. Functions and modular programming

3. One-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays

4. Pointers and dynamic memory allocation (malloc, realloc, free)

5. File handling (fopen, fprintf, fgets, etc.)

6. Recursion

7. String handling (strtok, strcpy, strcmp, etc.)

📂 Data Storage

The program stores all records in:

students.txt


This file is created automatically after the first run.

📝 Sample Output

🙌 Acknowledgement

I made this project as part of my C Programming course under the guidance of Mohsin F. Dar, UPES.
This project helped me understand practical use of C and strengthen my basics.
